I found for my DeWalt 7491RS, printed as above, the ideal dimensions were:

 * slot_width = 19.25; // 19.25 Perfect;  19.2 - hair loose, 19.3 snug in a few spots
 * slot_height = 10.40; // total height

But it took quite a bit of trial and error to dial in and you will likely need to do several 1-segment tests on your own equipment.
